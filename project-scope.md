**Insights Analytica Consults** have been contracted by JLRD College of Technology, a school in Africa to help them build a solution that 
proactively leverages data to improve candidates’ performance in not just JAMB, but all their upcoming final exams.

With students set to write JAMB and WASSCE again soon, we’ve been given a goal to ensure that an overwhelming majority of candidates score above average in their performance. 
How do we use data to ensure the students have great performance in the exams. 

**Objectives:**

- Identify possible problems students might be facing while writing these exams bearing in mind that this would involve starting from the scratch as most schools do not have the foundational data infrastructure to solve this problem.  
- Generate your data through any means based on the needs of your solution while ensuring that your data adequately reflects the state of the African education ecosystem
- Design an enterprise data solution for the school’s data collection, pipelining, warehousing, automation and reporting needs.
- Create an optimised model that predicts the likelihood of a student passing or failing their upcoming exam based on their academic history. Consider all factors that could affect a student's upcoming result aside from their previous exam scores.
- Make relevant recommendations to the Stakeholders on how they can help improve the performance of the students based on your solution

**Scope**

1. Data Collection: Develop methods to collect various types of data
2. Data Structuring: Create a database schema to store the collected data efficiently.
3. Data Analysis: Use data analytics techniques to identify key factors affecting student performance.
4. Model Development
5. Reporting and Visualization

 
**Deliverables:**

- Data Collection Plan: Outline the methods and tools used for data generation and collection.
- Data warehouse dictionary: Provide detailed information about your data warehouse design, including database, schema, tables, relationships, data types etc
- Analytical Models: Present the predictive models (if any) and analysis performed on the data.
- Final Solution: Build a solution (report, app, visual, web page etc) that highlights the key insights, shows trends and correlations, and provides actionable recommendations for stakeholders to improve the performance of candidates

**Points to Note:**

-  Ensure your solution fits into the African secondary educational ecosystem
- There should be a minimum of 50 students in a class of students.
- The data warehouse should be designed for the entire school and should cover all activities within the school. It should not be limited to just exam result related information
Note: It should solve the school’s data collection problem.
